  <h2>
  I know, I know, you probably never used GitHub before and its the most confusing social network website there is. I know. I know.
  <p>
    But just read this first!
    <p>
      <h3>
        Okay, this whole GitHub project is where most of the code of VAE Industries is placed.
        <h2>
          You see that button on the top right of this text that says "</> Code"? <p>
        <h3>
          What you're going to want to do is to click on "Projects" on the right side of where it says "</> Code".
          <h2>
        I want you to click it, find a "VAE industries" project... And there's our resources!
